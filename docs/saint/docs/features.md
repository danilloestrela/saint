saint add my-react-app    # Automatically sets up React commands
saint add my-python-api   # Sets up Python development commands
```

### Project Templates
Pre-configured templates for common project types with best practices built-in.

- **React/Next.js** - Development server, build, test commands
- **Node.js** - npm/yarn integration, dev/prod modes
- **Python** - Virtual environment, pip management
- **Docker** - Container management and deployment

### Project Organization
Keep all your projects organized in one place with easy navigation and management.

```bash
saint list                    # See all projects
saint cd my-project          # Quick navigation
saint backup my-project      # Create backups
```

## Auto-Update System

### Smart Update Checking
Saint automatically checks for updates every 7 days and notifies you when new versions are available.

Automatic backup creation before updates to ensure your data is safe.

## Command Aliases

### Project-Specific Commands
Each project gets its own set of commands based on its type and configuration.

# React project commands
my-react-app run      # npm start
my-react-app build    # npm run build
my-react-app test     # npm test

# Node.js project commands
my-api dev            # npm run dev
my-api start          # npm start
my-api debug          # npm run debug
```

### Custom Aliases
Create your own project-specific shortcuts and commands.
