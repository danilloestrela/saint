## Saint: Project Manager in Bash/Shell

Saint is a project manager made in bash/shell.

It was initially created to facilitate the organization of my projects in WSL2. Over time, it gained structure and an architecture to handle the automatic creation and removal of projects, as well as simple and unique aliases for each project. This allows you to manage any project easily from any folder in the terminal, saving time when creating and editing common elements in programming projects.

### Installation Guide:
#### Linux (Ubuntu/WSL)
1. Clone Saint to your user's root directory. (`~/`).
2. In the user root, locate the .bashrc file.
3. Use "nano" or your preferred editor to add the following code at the end of the file:
    ```
    if [ -s ~/saint/.saint ]; then
        . ~/saint/.saint
    fi
    ```
4. If using [Oh my Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), add it to the `.zshrc` file.
5. After that, restart the terminal. If you see the message: `Saint is running`, then it's ready to use.

#### Mac
To install Saint on a Mac, follow these steps:

1. Clone Saint to your user's root directory. (`~/`).

2. Open the Terminal and check if the `.zshrc` file exists in your home directory:
    ```bash
    ls -la ~ | grep .zshrc
    ```
    If the file does not exist, create it with the following command:
    ```bash
    touch ~/.zshrc
    ```

3. Edit the `.zshrc` file with a text editor of your choice:
    - Using `nano`:
      ```bash
      nano ~/.zshrc
      ```
    - Using `vim`:
      ```bash
      vim ~/.zshrc
      ```
    - Using `Visual Studio Code`:
      ```bash
      code ~/.zshrc
      ```

4. Add the following code at the end of the `.zshrc` file to source Saint whenever a terminal session starts:
    ```bash
    if [ -s ~/saint/.saint ]; then
        . ~/saint/.saint
    fi
    ```

5. Save the file and restart the terminal. If you see the message `Saint is running`, then Saint is successfully installed and ready to use.

### Some Observations:
1. Originally, I edited Saint using Visual Studio Code, but you are free to enhance it with the IDE of your choice.
2. This is my first open source project, mainly because I thought it could add more to the community. This means I am more than open to suggestions and help to make it the best possible for everyone.
